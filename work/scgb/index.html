<p>Since soundcloud has removed the group feature we&rsquo;ve created very small python application called &ldquo;<strong>S</strong>ound<strong>C</strong>loud <strong>G</strong>roup <strong>B</strong>ot&rdquo;, which automatically reposts tracks and playlists submitted to the “group” when user puts URL of track in the comment section, creating a nice list of submissions.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the soundcloud API has a lot of limitations, this program works perfectly.</p>
