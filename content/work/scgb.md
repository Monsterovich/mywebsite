Since soundcloud has removed the group feature we've created very small python application called "**S**ound**C**loud **G**roup **B**ot", which automatically reposts tracks and playlists submitted to the “group” when user puts URL of track in the comment section, creating a nice list of submissions. 

Despite the fact that the soundcloud API has a lot of limitations, this program works perfectly.
